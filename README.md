# 2D-Rubik-s-Cube

  The program I made is suppose to simulate a 3d Rubik’s Cube and all of itsfunctionalities like moving a cube’s face clockwise.The first thought that went through my mindis how I was gonna map the cube. Initially I thought making a 3D Array would be the bestapproach, the problem with that is you don't have access to every cell on the cube.The next method was to just make a 2d Array, The first bracket would represent the sides of the cube andthe second bracket would represent the number of cells per side, like so Array[Side#][Cell#].
  
  I noticed that there is not any middle moves because it’s never used to solve it anyway.Once Iknew all the moves that needed to be done, I made all the face moves Functions(Lines 9-22).This involves lots of swapping of values, I used the swap function, this helped to make the code a little more shorter and easier to understand.Lets say I wanted to do “R” move fromFigure(2),The first step is to find out what direction the values move by using Figure(1).In thiscase the “R” move goes in this order of faces 0,3,2,1 .Next we have to find out what cells arebeing moved, for the “R” move its 2,5,8. So now that we know the values that need to be movedthe swap would have the following parameters swap(Array[0][2],Array[3][2]), the first bracketrepresents the face of cube and second bracket represents the square cell number. This swap had to be repeated for each of faces and three cells that were being moved with.The next function Imade was to make a fresh unmixed cube.The way to do that was to pick the letter you want foreach of the 6 faces with an if statement and loop through all the individual square cells andassign them the letter picked. All the moves function have 3 loops within them to move the 3square cells to the new face. There is a function to input into the cube by running two for loops to input into all the cells but this is takes a long time so to test it I just made the main start off with a fresh unmixed cube, and start making moves from there.
