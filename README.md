# 2D-Rubik-s-Cube

  The program I made is suppose to simulate a 3d Rubik’s Cube and all of itsfunctionalities like moving a cube’s face clockwise. Initially I thought making a 3D Array would be the logical approach, the problem with that is you don't have access to every cell on the cube, for example the corner peices on a real rubiks cube are not actually 3 seperate squares but 3 squares combined.The next method was to just make a 2d Array, The first Array bracket would represent the side number of the cube and the second bracket would represent the cell number or square,so Array[Side#][Cell#]. The "move functions" are very hard coded in my opinion and there's room for improvment on this. Maybe make a version that can be expandable to any size cube?
